# ip_subnet_converter

## What does this do?
This is a simple Python script that converts IP addresses from decimal to binary, binary to decimal, and binary to hex.

More features will be added as the class it was created for continues. Planned new features:
+ decimal to hex
+ error checking (to ensure entries are in a proper format)

## How to use it

### Install Python
#### OS X:
If you have a mac, Python is already installed! Just run the script by launching terminal and typing in "python ip_subnet.py" from the folder you have downloaded the script to. Or, alternatively, from any location "python <path to folder of script>\python ip_subnet.py"

#### Windows:
You can install Python on Windows (Google it). Or for a simpler solution, I would recommend installing Portable Python on a thumb drive. You can get it here: http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython3.2.5.1/

Download and run the installer. To run this script, from the command line, run the Portable Python executable passing the script as a parameter.

Python-Portable.exe ip_subnet.py
